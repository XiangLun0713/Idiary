# Idiary Official Website
This is the official website that I made for my Idiary Android Application, which I build using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 framework. It is the first website that I build on my own, i.e. without refering to any tutorials. <a href="https://xianglun.me/Idiary" target="_blank">Click here to go to Idiary Official Website</a>
